MISSION

Our mission is to empower our
investors with the ability and confidence to trade a variety of instruments and
strategies successfully for themselves through education and communication; but
in doing so, build the trust needed to allow Asymmetry to manage these investments
or strategies on their behalf due to time constraints and other interests or
skills that require our investors' attention on a day-to-day basis.
